## 🌍 Three-Layer Architecture

The LIFE System operates through three interconnected layers:

### Layer 1: Local Life Circles (50-500 people)
- **Community-scale organization** with shared resources and democratic governance
- **Worker-owned cooperatives** providing meaningful work and shared prosperity
- **Local currencies** keeping wealth circulating within communities
- **Resource sharing networks** reducing costs while improving access

### Layer 2: Bioregional Webs (10,000-1,000,000 people)
- **Ecological boundary organization** aligning human activity with natural systems
- **Resource optimization** across multiple communities based on carrying capacity
- **Knowledge sharing networks** accelerating innovation and problem-solving
- **Crisis response coordination** providing mutual aid during emergencies

### Layer 3: Planetary Coordination (Global scale)
- **Global knowledge commons** sharing innovations and discoveries freely
- **Climate response systems** coordinating planetary-scale environmental action
- **Resource balancing protocols** ensuring fair allocation of scarce global resources
- **Peace and cooperation frameworks** addressing root causes of conflict

## 💡 Core Principles

### 🤝 Cooperation Over Competition
Economic relationships based on mutual benefit and shared prosperity rather than zero-sum competition.

### 🌱 Regeneration Over Extraction
Economic activity that enhances rather than degrades the natural systems supporting all life.

### 🏛️ Democracy Over Hierarchy
Participatory decision-making that gives everyone a voice in shaping their economic relationships.

### 📚 Sharing Over Hoarding
Open knowledge commons and resource circulation that create abundance through cooperation.

### 🎯 Purpose Over Profit
Economic organization that serves human needs and ecological health rather than capital accumulation.
